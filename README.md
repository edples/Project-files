# Predictions for sales
The files used for the project and the script file.
The repositories contains the 4 csvs used for prediction and the script.
The script written by me in R, to aim the predictions is the "evopricingweekly2.R".
As the datasets are small, the model used was a polinomial regression, which gave a 72.61% explanation of the target variability.
